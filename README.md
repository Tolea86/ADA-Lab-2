# Decoupling

**Coupling** describes the degree of dependency between one entity to another entity. Loose coupling is good because we don't want the components of our system to heavily depend on each other. We want to keep our system modular, where we can safely change one part without affecting the other.

When two parts are loosely coupled, they are more independent of each other and are less likely to break when the other changes. Most important factor of **Decoupling** is to create a system with minimum dependencies and minimum assumptions.

**Temporal Decoupling** is used to decouple components in way that changes/remove/addition of components does not disrupt the work of other components

**Spatial Decoupling** is used to decouple components which can be located in any place and work together as a system.
